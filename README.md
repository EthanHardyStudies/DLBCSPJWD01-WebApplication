# BookWishlist

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.4.

## Installation

This is a Node.js module available through the npm registry.

Before installing, download and install Node.js. Be sure to install Node.js version 20.15.0

Installation is done using the npm install command:
```bash
npm install @angular/cli@19.1.3
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

On Windows client computers, the execution of PowerShell scripts is disabled by default. To allow the execution of PowerShell scripts, which is needed for npm global binaries, you must set the following execution policy:

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

Carefully read the message displayed after executing the command and follow the instructions. Make sure you understand the implications of setting an execution policy.

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
